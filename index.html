            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>My name is madhumitha from salem .You are the only one who knows yourself best. Everyone around you has different things to tell about you, but only you know your true self. There are billions of people on this planet, and every person has a different purpose. Each person finds their mission differently and has a different journey. Thus, when I write about myself, I write about my journey and what makes the person I am because of the trip. I try to be myself, be passionate about my dreams and hobbies, live honestly, and work hard to achieve all that I want to make. </p>
            <p>Each person has different hobbies, and doing different things gives them joy. Baking is something that gives me comfort and helps me relax.
                 I tried baking after entering college. At first, it was a little stressful, but then I started learning more and more.
                  After a hectic day at college, it helps to relax you. Another thing that helps me relax is reading books. 
                  I started reading books when I was in school, and over the years, the habit is something that has helped me learn a lot.</p>
            <p>Dreams and aspirations: While many people have dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers, I have always wanted to be a traveler. 
                I dont remember when I fell in love with traveling, but over the years, my passion for traveling has increased. 
                Over the past few months, I have started living this dream, and it gives me so much joy.</p>
